	<h1> Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a way to measure how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. 
    It helps developers determine how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time. 
    By analyzing time complexity, we can compare different algorithms and choose the one that performs tasks 
    more efficiently, especially for large datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion. 
    It takes into account the memory required for variables, data structures, and function calls. 
    Understanding Space Complexity helps in designing algorithms that make optimal use of available resources. 
    For example, an algorithm with a Space Complexity of O(n) grows linearly with the input size, meaning 
    that the memory usage increases proportionally as the input data increases.
